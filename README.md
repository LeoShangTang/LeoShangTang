    I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, originally from Calgary. As an aspiring UI/UX designer, I have a passion for crafting engaging and user-friendly layouts for various projects. Beyond coding, I have a strong passion for graphic design and enjoy playing badminton. Whether I'm creating digital artwork or playing on the court, I always strive to do my best!
